Based on the error you're seeing, the issue is that your PDF file exceeds Vercel's built-in size limits. Here's a comprehensive solution:

## **Root Cause**
Vercel has request body size limits:
- **Hobby Plan**: 4.5MB maximum
- **Pro Plan**: 50MB maximum

## **Solution Summary**
I need to implement file size validation and better error handling. The solution includes:

1. **Frontend validation** - Check file size before upload
2. **Backend validation** - Double-check file size with clear error messages  
3. **Vercel configuration** - Optimize function settings
4. **User guidance** - Clear error messages explaining limits and solutions

**Immediate workarounds for you:**
1. **Compress your PDF** - Try reducing the file size to under 4MB
2. **Split large PDFs** - Break large documents into smaller sections
3. **Use online PDF compressors** - Tools like SmallPDF can reduce file size

**Would you like me to implement the complete fix with file size validation, or do you need help comp
